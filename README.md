# Content-Based Movie Recommendation 

This project builds a simple movie recommendation system that utilizes the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. It provides recommendations based on content-based filtering, focusing on movie metadata such as cast, director, category, and movie description.

## Methodology

The recommendation system uses content-based filtering to suggest similar movies. It computes similarity scores between movies based on various features. Then, the top 5 movies with the highest similarity scores are recommended.

## Dataset

The TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset contains metadata for over 5000 movies, including information on cast, crew, budget, and revenue, among others. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
